# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a deep learning model for classifying images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using a dataset consisting of images of dogs and cats sourced from Kaggle. Various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures are implemented to achieve accurate classification of the images into their respective categories.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from Kaggle, specifically the "Dogs vs Cats" dataset by Salader. It contains a large collection of images of dogs and cats labeled with their corresponding categories. The dataset is downloaded and extracted using the Kaggle API.

## Usage
<ol>
  <li>Download and prepare the dataset using the provided Kaggle dataset link.</li>
  <li>Execute the Jupyter Notebook dogs_vs_cats_classification.ipynb to preprocess the data, create and train the CNN model, and evaluate its performance.</li>
  <li>Ensure proper image preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and resizing, are applied to the dataset.</li>
  <li>Train the model using the prepared dataset and evaluate its accuracy and loss on the validation set.</li>
  <li>Fine-tune the model architecture and hyperparameters to achieve better performance if necessary.</li>
</ol>

## Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction. Batch normalization and dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting. The final layer employs the sigmoid activation function for binary classification between dogs and cats.

## Evaluation and Results
The model is trained over multiple epochs, and its performance is evaluated using both training and validation datasets. Metrics such as accuracy and loss are monitored to assess the model's performance and identify any potential overfitting or underfitting issues.
